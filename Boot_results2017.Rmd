## Methods

The mass of individual rainbow trout and eastern brook trout measured only for fork length (`r paste0("n=",nrow(no.wt))` and `r paste0("n=",nrow(no.wt.EB))`, respectively) was predicted using the log length to mass relationship from individual fish measured for both fork length and mass (`r paste0("n=",nrow(wt.EB))` and `r paste0("n=",nrow(wt.EB))`, respectively) and then back-transformed following Ogle (2016). 


Ages were predicted for individual fish without measured ages using a length-age key (n=`r nrow(RB.noages.lk.catch)`). However, fish smaller than `r lcat10.toosmall.current` mm were not sampled for age and therefore the age of these fish could not be predicted (n=`r n.toosmall.current`). 


## Results

The relationship between mass and length for the catch in 2017 is shown in Figure FLWT. In 2017, eastern brook trout gained mass more quickly than rainbow trout as their length increased (p `r fit.growth.p`). From 2002 to 2017, the gain of mass per increment of fork length did not differ greatly for either rainbow trout (p = `r p.flwtyrs.RB`) or eastern brook trout (p = `r p.flwtyrs.EB`).



## Tables

Table 1. Summary of eastern brook trout (EB) and rainbow trout (RB) catch during Boot Lake gillnet sampling in September 2017. Catch was summarized by number of fish caught (n), fork length (FL; mm), mass (M; g), and condition factor (K) mean and range. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) is calculated as number of fish caught per hour of gillnet fishing.
